Before joining Argonne, Jan Hückelheim was a postdoc at Imperial College London. He received his PhD degree from Queen Mary University of London in 2017, under the supervision of Jens-Dominik Mueller. His research spans the fields of automatic differentiation, formal software verification, scientific computing, and compilers. He has published in a variety of journals and conferences including ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, SC, PPoPP, and IPDPS, and contributed to the automatic differentiation tool Tapenade.

Patrick is a professor at UT Austin in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences with joint appointments in the Jackson School of Geosciences, and the Institute of Geophysics. He is a core faculty member at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, and holds the W.A. Moncrief, Jr. endowed chair III in Simulation-Based Engineering and Sciences. His main research interest is understanding the general circulation of the ocean and its role in the global climate system. He has been responsible for the automatic differentiation-enabled adjoint code generation and maintenance of the MITgcm, the core machinery underlying ECCO.

Ludger is a final-year PhD candidate at TU Munich under the auspices of [Nikolaus A. Adams](https://www.epc.ed.tum.de/en/aer/members/cv/prof-adams/) with a MSc in Applied Mathematic from Imperial College London. He is interested in new approaches to composability between simulations and machine learning techniques with an eye toward enabling more affordable workflows for Scientific Machine Learning, Uncertainty Quantification, and Simulation-based inference. For this he expansively builds on the LLVM, and MLIR toolchain for compiler-based automatic differentiation with Enzyme, and specialized JIT’ing for simulations.
