<p>Ludger is a sixth-year PhD candidate at TU Munich under the auspices of <a href="https://www.epc.ed.tum.de/en/aer/members/cv/prof-adams/">Nikolaus A. Adams</a> with a MSc in Applied Mathematic from Imperial College London. He is interested in new approaches to composability between simulations and machine learning techniques with an eye toward enabling more affordable workflows for Scientific Machine Learning, Uncertainty Quantification, and Statistical inference. For this he expansively builds on the LLVM, and MLIR toolchain for compiler-based automatic differentiation with Enzyme, and specialized JITâ€™ing for simulations with jax.infer.</p>
